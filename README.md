# Yelp-GroupFeatureAddOnPrototype-UXDesignProject
I worked on a UX design project with my group from CPSC 344 class in UBC. Following the UX design principles we first identified an existing issue of indecision during choosing a restaurant for a group meal. We then confirmed this issue through student surveys and identified particular issues and addressed these problems through a prototype that is an add on to the current Yelp application.  We decided to add a new feature to the Yelp interface which we called Group Suggestions. Users will be able to create profiles with their cuisine and dietary preferences as well as dietary restrictions. Then, after creating a group event and adding people, the system will come up with recommendations based on common preferences and group dietary restrictions.
